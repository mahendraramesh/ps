# Problem Solving

[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-1187941-16/ps)](https://github.com/sangupta/ps)

`ps` is a collection of various computing problems and their corresponding solutions
that I could think of. The problems range in various categories such as design,
algorithms, performance optimizations, and more.

Feel free to add a [Github issue](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/issues) for any discrepancy,
typo, alternatives, or a different solution that I might not have considered. Also feel free to
add issues for problems that you would like me to work upon - though it may take me a few days to
research and jot my notes here.

If you wish to contribute please read the [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Dedicated to all the friends who inspired me to learn and experiment.**
